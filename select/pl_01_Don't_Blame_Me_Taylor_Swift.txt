Don't blame me
Love made me crazy
If it doesn't, you ain't doin' it right
Lord save me, my drug is my baby
I'll be using for the rest of my life
I been breaking hearts a long time
And toying with them older guys
Just playthings for me to use
Something happened for the first time
In the darkest little paradise
Shaking, pacing I just need you
For you, I would cross the line
I would waste my time I would lose my mind
They say 'she's gone too far this...time'
CHORUS:
Don't blame me
Love made me crazy
If it doesn't, you ain't doin' it right
Lord save me, my drug is my baby
I'll be using for the rest of my life
Don't blame me
Love made me crazy
If it doesn't, you ain't doin' it right
Oh, Lord save me, my drug is my baby
I'll be using for the rest of my life
My name is whatever you decide and
I'm just gonna call you 'mine'
I'm insane...but I'm your baby
Echoes of your name inside my mind
Halo, hiding my obsession
I was once poison ivy
But now I'm your daisy
And baby for you, I would fall from grace
Just to touch your face
If you walk away
I'd beg you on my knees to...stay
CHORUS
I get so high (oh!)
Every time you're, every time you're
Loving me, You're loving me
Trip of my life (oh!)
Every time you're, every time you're
Touching me...you're touching me
Every time you're, every time you're loving me.
Oh, Lord save me, my drug is my baby
I'll be using for the rest of my life
CHORUS
I get so high (oh!)
Every time you're, every time you're
Loving me, You're loving me
Oh, Lord save me, my drug is my baby
I'll be using for the rest of my life
