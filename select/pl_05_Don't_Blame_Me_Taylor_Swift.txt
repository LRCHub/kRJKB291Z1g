You touch me too softly
And I know what that means
That you don't really love me
As morose as it seems
When I leave
I'll pull on the last of
our strings
And you'll see
That there's always
the next thing
There's always the next thing
I'm cutting our ties,
that's all I can do
(Don't blame me)
Don't act surprised,
it's only for you
(Don't blame me)
The best of our times were
the worst of your life
Tell me who you're lying to
Cover your eyes,
but peer through the lines
'Cause when I cry,
it's only for you
All I did was agree
To mask all the missteps
for our chemistry
Was it all you had dreamed?
Was I all you hate
but you knew that I'd be?
I'm cutting our ties,
that's all I can do
(Don't blame me)
Don't act surprised,
it's only for you
(Don't blame me)
The best of our times were
the worst of your life
Tell me who you're lying to
Cover your eyes,
but peer through the lines
'Cause when I cry,
it's only for you
No, this path never stops
And I'm already sick of
the next mountain-top
No, this high couldn't last
In a moment it'll move on
and stay in the past
We were never in love
So when we were fucking,
who were you thinking of?
No, I'm never enough
I'll fall from your hands
straight into your gloves
No, this path never stops
And I'm already sick of
the next mountain-top
Know this high didn't last
In a moment it'll move on
and stay in the past
We were never in love
So when we were fucking,
who were you thinking of?
No, I'm never enough
And I'll fall from your hands
straight into your gloves
