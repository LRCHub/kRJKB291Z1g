I think about that summer
Falling way too fast
Yeah, we were just a season
Yeah, too damn hot to last
I held you for a moment
Let the moment slip away
And I know you won't forgive me
for the things I didn't say
Now, it's too late
Yeah, it's too late
It's getting late
Blame me for the ending
Hell, blame me for the start
Blame me for the wall
you had to build
around your heart
Blame me for the hurting
All the hell I put you through
You can swear it's all my fault
And I won't blame you if you do
But don't blame me,
don't blame me
Don't blame me for loving you
You were more than
I could handle
You were more than I deserve
You loved me like the devil
Sang the songs I never heard
I was drowning in an ocean
I was in over my head
If I could just go back,
I'd undo everything I did
But it's too late
Yeah, it's too late
Yeah, it's getting late
Blame me for the ending
Hell, blame me for the start
Blame me for the wall
you had to build
around your heart
Blame me for the hurting
And all the hell
I put you through
You can swear it's all my fault
And I won't blame you if you do
But don't blame me,
don't blame me
Don't blame me for loving you
Is it too late?
Is it too late?
Say it's not too late
Blame me for the ending
Hell, blame me for the start
You can blame me for the wall
you had to build
around your heart
Blame me for the hurting
And all the hell
I put you through
You can swear it's all my fault
And I won't blame you if you do
But don't blame me,
don't blame me
Don't blame me for loving you
Don't blame me for loving you
Don't blame me for loving you
Don't blame me for loving you
