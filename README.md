[00:02.13] Don't blame me, love made me crazy
[00:05.27] If it doesn't, you ain't doin' it right
[00:08.95] Lord, save me, my drug is my baby
[00:12.02] I'll be usin' for the rest of my life
[00:30.52] 
[00:17.62] I've been breakin' hearts a long time
[00:21.78] And, toyin' with them older guys
[00:25.29] Just playthings for me to use
[00:31.60] Something happened for the first time
[00:35.73] In the darkest little paradise
[00:39.06] Shakin', pacin', I just need you
[00:55.06] 
[00:45.16] For you, I would cross the line
[00:49.69] I would waste my time
[00:53.12] I would lose my mind
[00:57.18] They say, she's gone too far this time
[01:16.18] 
[01:00.48] Don't blame me, love made me crazy
[01:03.26] If it doesn't, you ain't doin' it right
[01:07.53] Lord, save me, my drug is my baby
[01:10.13] I'll be usin' for the rest of my life
[01:28.63] 
[01:14.24] Don't blame me, love made me crazy
[01:17.57] If it doesn't, you ain't doin' it right
[01:21.05] Oh, Lord, save me, my drug is my baby
[01:24.59] I'll be usin' for the rest of my life
[01:43.09] 
[01:28.58] My name is whatever you decide, and
[01:33.33] I'm just gonna call you mine
[01:35.66] I'm insane, but I'm your baby
[01:39.60] (Your baby)
[01:42.07] Echoes (echoes), of your name inside my mind
[01:46.18] Halo, hiding my obsession
[01:49.01] I once was poison ivy, but now I'm your daisy
[02:11.51] 
[01:54.97] And baby, for you, I would fall from grace
[02:00.10] Just to touch your face
[02:03.45] If you walk away
[02:07.34] I'd beg you on my knees to stay
[02:22.84] 
[02:10.65] Don't blame me, love made me crazy
[02:13.57] If it doesn't, you ain't doin' it right
[02:17.57] Lord, save me, my drug is my baby
[02:20.54] I'll be usin' for the rest of my life (yeah, ooh)
[02:45.04] 
[02:24.98] Don't blame me, love made me crazy
[02:27.87] If it doesn't, you ain't doin' it right
[02:31.68] Oh, Lord, save me, my drug is my baby
[02:34.83] I'll be usin' for the rest of my life
[02:53.33] 
[02:37.93] I get so high, oh!
[02:40.58] Every time you're, every time you're lovin' me
[02:44.06] You're lovin' me
[02:45.02] Trip of my life, oh!
[02:47.67] Every time you're, every time you're touchin' me
[02:50.92] You're touchin' me
[02:54.46] Every time you're, every time you're lovin' me
[03:17.46] 
[02:59.80] Oh, Lord, save me, my drug is my baby
[03:03.37] I'll be using for the rest of my life
[03:05.53] (Using for the rest of my life, oh!)
[03:23.53] 
[03:09.46] Don't blame me, love made me crazy
[03:12.06] If it doesn't, you ain't doin' it right
[03:15.01] (Doin' it right, no)
[03:16.59] Lord, save me, my drug is my baby
[03:19.23] I'll be usin' for the rest of my life (oh-oh)
[03:41.73] 
[03:23.22] Don't blame me, love made me crazy
[03:26.47] If it doesn't, you ain't doin' it right
[03:28.72] (You ain't doin' it right)
[03:29.83] Oh, Lord, save me, my drug is my baby
[03:33.14] I'll be usin' (I'll be usin') for the rest of my life (oh, I'll be usin')
[04:09.64] 
[03:36.43] I get so high, oh!
[03:38.59] Every time you're, every time you're lovin' me
[03:42.39] You're lovin' me
[03:43.79] Oh, Lord, save me, my drug is my baby
[03:47.36] I'll be usin' for the rest of my life
